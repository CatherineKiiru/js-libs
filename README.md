# JavaScript Framework Library "bundle" plugins

This repository contains a collection of popular JavaScript libraries, packaged as __[jenkins-js-modules]__ bundles that
`export` themselves, allowing their top level module (the JavaScript framework library) to be
`import`<sub>ed</sub> by modules in other bundles, allowing these other modules to remain as lightweight as possible,
while still modular in nature.

> See __[jenkins-js-modules]__ for more.
